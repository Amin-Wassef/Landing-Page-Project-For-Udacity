Starter HTML and a CSS codes were given.

For the HTML code, it was divided into:
                        .A navigator bar containing an empty unordered list tag.
                        .A head tag refers to the project name.
                        .Three sections tags containing head and paragraphs each.

For the Css code, it contained styling for:
                        .Background.
                        .Navigation bar.
                        .Sections and their contents.
                        .Animated circles.

An empty javascript file was given to work into...

My work done was:
    .I added 2 more section tags with there classes and ids to the HTML file.
    .I made little modifications (justify and recolor) to Css file.
    .I added a new => .your-active-class for the distinguish of the navigation lists.
    .I constructed an array from section tags => used in construction of appendChild method for adding lists in the navigation bar through for loop.
    .The navigation lists were anchored to the section tags through section id.
    .The default navigation on click event was been prevented and replaced by scroll navigation.
    .The last thing was, the adjustment of viewport of a section and its navigating list to be distinguished using classList.add and classsList.remove methods through conditions with or without a function.
